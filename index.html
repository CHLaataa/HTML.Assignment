        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hey everyone my name is <strong>Ayden</strong>, I am an international student from Hong Kong, who studied in Vancouver, <abbr>B.C.</abbr> for high school. I was born in Aug 27<sup>th</sup>, 2002. I recently just came to Ontario for the first time to study in Algonquin. I actually got transferred into IMD after enrolled in the Aviation Pilot program, I never thought I would be studying in the design field. Though I do find this program sort of exciting just by checking out everything we would be working on. </p>

        <p>
            The one thing I am most passionate about is Dancing. Ever since joining the dance club during high school. I fell in love with performing on stage where I am able to work with others to present a better performance. To me, it is so expressive and it requires no words. When I dance, I enjoy myself and try and get better every single time, losing myself in the music. I dance mostly to K-Pop, Jazzfunk, Hip-hop, and a little bit of Dancehall. I'm still practicing and trying to get better cause I'm still not that good yet. But it does help build my confidence and helped me a lot when I am stressed.
        </p>

        <q>I would like to say every moment counts for you, so make the time that you spend on your dreams a very special moment, make sure that you do something that you will be happy with when you go back and look at yourself.</q> <cite>Jennie Kim</cite>
